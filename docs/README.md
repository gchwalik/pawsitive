# Pawsitive Documentation 

This folder contains all the docs about design decisions, the prd, versions of the data models, etc. 

## Tools 

Diagram/modeling tools:
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
- [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/)

## Data Models 

Right now versioned data models are in `/docs/data_models`.

The `.drawio` file can be imported into draw.io for editing/etc, and the `.jpg` is included for easy viewing outside of that tool.
