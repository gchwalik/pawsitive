# Team Definition of Ready (Proposal)

This document proposes a team wide Defintion of Ready for backlog tiems.

builds on [documented Issue #173](<https://github.com/users/gchwalik/projects/3/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=129055973&issue=gchwalik%7Cpawsitive%7C173>) and will serve as a reference point for sprint planning.

### Principle
**An item is "Ready" when the assignment can begin immediately with no unresolved blockers**

---

### Working Ticket Proposal
1. Outcome - 1-2 sentences naming the user and the value.
2. Acceptance Criteria (steps 3-7) - include at least one edge/empty/error case.
3. Size - Ticket must be **M or smaller before starting**. If initially L or larger, it must be split before active work.  
4. **T-shirt sizing** – Based on **individual velocity** rather than a "senior baseline." Refined further when the ticket is picked up.
   - XS – < ½ day  
   - S – ~1 day  
   - M – 2–3 days  
   - L – ~1 week (**must break down**)  
   - XL – 2–3 weeks (**must break down**)  
   - XXL – very large/unknown (proposal only, **must break down**) 
4. Asset Links - Provide the **minimum necessary inputs** to unblock work.  
   - For frontend tickets, a quick sketch (30–40 seconds) is enough.  
   - If a mockup would be materially useful, create a **separate ticket** and link it.  
   - Written descriptions or layout notes are acceptable substitutes.  
5. Dependencies Managed - name external things work relies on & plan of action/date for resolution.
6. Validation - 3-6 steps a teammate can follow to confirm it works.
7. Priority Confirmed - product Owner and atleast one team member gives a thumbs up.

### Feature overlay
- Purpose & Success metric goal - Why are we doing this, and how will success be measured?(latency target etc.)
- Scope Bounds - Define (what's in/out; first releasable slice)
- High Level (where does the feature touch in the system & how parts work together; before split into tickets)
- Story Map (2-6 Tickets) - each should pass the Ticket checklist
- Rollout & Validation (flag/gradual release and how we will confirm value with metrics, logs etc.)
- T-shirt Estimate/ Target window - Features get an initial estimate(XL etc. if ealry )(for planning only; before pullen into a sprint) **must break down**

### Common elements of DOR:
- **Story is clear, well described, and understood by the team.**
The work item should have concise and comprehensive descriptions of the what and why. Must include who it is for(end user)
- **Acceptance criteria are defined, measurable, and testable.**
Story or feature should have clear conditions that can be testable.
- **Work is small enough to fit within one iteration.**
Large work should be split up into smaller tickets to be realistically completed within a sprint.
- **Any necessary designs, content, or assets are available.**
If the story requires UI mockups, images, datasets or other assets, they should be accessible to the team before development starts.
