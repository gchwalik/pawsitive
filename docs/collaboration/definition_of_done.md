- [x] Code merged into main branch without conflicts
- [x] Documentation updated (inline comments, README, or API docs if applicable)
- ~~[x] Feature/bug verified manually (smoke test in dev/staging environment)~~

# âœ… Definition of Done Template

### ðŸ”¹ Code Quality

- [ ] Code compiles with no errors or warnings
- [ ] Code is clean, readable, and follows team conventions
- [ ] At least one peer has reviewed and approved the PR

### ðŸ”¹ Testing

- [ ] Unit tests cover new/changed logic
- [ ] All tests (unit + integration) pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Manual smoke test confirms the feature/bug fix works as expected

### ðŸ”¹ Documentation

- [ ] Inline code comments explain complex logic
- [ ] README / relevant docs updated if functionality or setup changed
- [ ] API/interface changes documented for other team members

### ðŸ”¹ Functionality

- [ ] Meets acceptance criteria in the story/ticket
- [ ] No known high-priority bugs remain unfixed
- [ ] Rollback/disable strategy considered (feature toggle, etc.)

### ðŸ”¹ Delivery

- [ ] Branch merged into `main` without conflicts
- [ ] Deployed successfully to staging/dev environment
- [ ] Verified by the assignee (or pair reviewer) in staging/dev
