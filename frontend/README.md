# Pawsitive Frontend

This is the Pawsitive frontend code.

It's built using React+Vite.

As mentioned in the project root README, you can launch the frontend dev server simply by running `make run` and then accessing it at `localhost:5173`.

## Dependencies

Because the project is wrapped in Docker, all you need to launch the frontend server is:

- docker
- make

Because all the code is built and runs in the container, your IDE will probably tell you that you don't have needed packages installed
in the frontend code. If this bothers you, you can resolve it with `npm install`.
