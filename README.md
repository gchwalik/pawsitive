# Pawsitive

Pawsitive is an application that helps dog walkers and owners find safe locations for their reactive dogs.

Reactive dogs generally have similar triggers - children, other dogs, loud noises - and Pawsitive aggregates notes about which locations have which triggers and when they might occur.
